# Project2-Weather
This project makes the Weather Forecast System.

**[Description]**

This app is for the people who need the up-to-date information of the weather. People can add their usual searched cities which will be displayed once people run the application. In this time, The data will be completely stored, so that in the next time people open the app, they can access the cities they added in the last time. The benefit of our app is that the weather information for a specific city will be checked if it needs to be updated through time (1h). Once the Weather Information stored in the WeatherTree exceeds 1 hourï¼Œthe next time this weather information is required to show will be automatically updated.

**[Installation]**

You just need to download the src folder. After cd (change direction) into the src folder, you can use the command ***make run*** to compile classes, jar, json, and other files together to allow the running of the application. 

**[Running]**

This app is based on the Terminal GUI where each time you want to give a command, you have to start with ***./weather***. 

For example, if you want to open the help document, you need to enter ***./weather --help*** OR ***./weather -h***.

**[Next Generation]**

In the next generation, we will mainly focus on establishing the more stable manner of reading api. Because the account of api only has one in this time and we did not implemented the method or command to allow users to change api account manually or automatically when the one is failed. Also, we will update more usage for this application to add more functions. The interface and executed carrier will be considered to update like in smartphone.
